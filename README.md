Welcome to the code and results files used along my end of degree project.



The folder *Video Preprocessing* contains a python file which I used for preprocessing the vocal cords' videos by using different techniques.

The folder *ML models* has all the excel files obtained from DeepLabCut with the coordinates of the predicted markers. It also contains two python files that were used for developing the two methods aimed at predicting the pathology of the patients by employing Machine Learning models.

The folder *Excel results tables* contains an excel file with 4 tables. Each of the two methods employed in the project was evaluated with Oversampled and Non-Oversampled data. Therefore, there is one table containing the results of each scenario: Method 1 with Oversampled and Non-Oversampled data, and the same with the second method.
